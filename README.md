# Snake
This repository contains a game written by me for my coursework.
## Building
The project can be built with either ```Build-Windows.bat``` or ```Build-Linux.sh```. In order to be built correctly, this project requires CMake and Python to be installed. On Linux, Jinja2 should also be installed before building.
